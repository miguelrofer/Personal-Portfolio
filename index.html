      <p>Hi, I am Miguel.</p>

      <p> Selling myself was never my main strength but I will try to do my best. </p>

      <p>I am currently studying a MSc in Computational and Data Journalism at Cardiff University. Previously I finished my undergraduate degree in Journalism at the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain).</p>

      <p>Before starting my Master's degree, I worked for five years in Spain covering political, local and economic affairs for national and regional newspapers (El País and La Opinion de A Coruña). I also published freelance for international news outlets such as the Portuguese newspaper Público. </p>

      <p>"Leaving your job in sunny Spain to come to the post-Brexit UK?" Yes, that is a recurring question, but hold on. Galicia (where I am from) is not that sunny and yes, I thought the skills I would gain in Cardiff would outweigh the risk I was taking. And at this point I can say I was right.</p>

      <p>In the last months I have learnt to code in <strong>Python</strong> to make statiscal and textual analysis, use <strong>Javascript</strong> to retrieve data from an API as well as create interactive graphs with <strong>D3</strong> and I have learnt to use <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> to design mobile applications from scratch. But if you would like static graphs using <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>, I can do it as well! </p>

      <p>I love financial information and politics so, as you can imagine, elections are a dream: there is tons of data to cross-reference with hundreds of variables and visualize with fancy graphs.</p>

      <p>I am fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Galician, so if by chance someone in the newsroom needs to understand the lastest quotes from the UN General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, or any president or tycoon in the Americas, I can help with the translation.</p>
