      <p>Hi, I am Miguel.</p>

      <p>Since August 2019, I work as a data reporter at ICIS, one of the world-leading publications covering energy and petrochemical markets. I am responsible for producing data-driven stories based on internal and external datasets as well as enhancing the data visualisation service.</p>

      <p>Previously, I have worked as a data journalist for Radar AI, the local data unit at the Press Association. I produced automated stories for local newspapers by using Artificial Intelligence tools and localised datasets, most of them from the ONS. I have also contributed to the front-end development of Radar's automated data visualisation service by using the D3 library of Javascript.</p>

      <p>I am a MSc graduate in Computational and Data Journalism at Cardiff University.</p>

      <p>Before moving to the UK to start my Master's degree, I worked for five years in Spain as a reporter covering political, local and economic affairs for national and regional newspapers, such as El País and La Opinion de A Coruña. </p>

      <p>During these years, I have learnt to code in <strong>Python</strong> or <strong>SQL</strong> to make statistical and textual analysis, use <strong>Javascript</strong> to retrieve data from APIs as well as create interactive graphs with <strong>D3</strong> and I have learnt to use <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> to design mobile applications from scratch.</p> 

      <p>I also have an advanced command on Tableau, Flourish, Datawrapper or Infogr.am, which are the main tools I currently use at ICIS. But if you would like static graphs using <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>, I can do it as well! </p>

      <p>I am perfectly fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Galician, and I am currently honing my French.</p>
